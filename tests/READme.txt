# Notes

Testing Asynchronous Code: All test functions are decorated with @pytest.mark.asyncio to support asynchronous execution.
Mocking External Dependencies: The unittest.mock library is used to mock external services and methods, allowing for isolated testing.
Test Cleanup: After each test, any created data (e.g., users, orders) is deleted to prevent interference with other tests.
Testing Permissions and Rate Limiting: Tests include scenarios for permission denial and rate limiting to ensure security features work as expected.
Frontend Testing: Uses msw (Mock Service Worker) to mock API calls in frontend tests, ensuring components render correctly without relying on a backend.

# Additional Tips
Running Tests:
Backend: Ensure you have the test database configured and run tests using pytest tests/.
Frontend: Run frontend tests using npm test from the frontend directory.
Continuous Integration: Include these tests in your CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests on each commit or pull request.
Test Coverage: Aim for high test coverage to catch potential issues early and maintain code quality.
